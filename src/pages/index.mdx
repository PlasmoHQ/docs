The [Plasmo](https://www.plasmo.com/) Framework is a battery-packed browser extension SDK made by hackers for hackers. Build your product and stop worrying about config files and the odd peculiarities of building browser extensions.

> It's like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for browser extensions!

![CLI Demo](https://www.plasmo.com/assets/plasmo-cli-demo.gif)

## Features

- First-class [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) Support
- [Declarative development with `manifest.json` auto-generation (MV3)](/#where-is-the-manifestjson-file)
- Live-reloading
- [`.env*` files](/workflows/env)
- [Remote code [bundling](/workflows/remote-code) (e.g., for gtag4)
- Automated deployment (via [BPP](/workflows/submit))
- And many, many more! 🚀

## System Requirements

- Node.js 16.x or later
- macOS, Windows, or Linux
- (Strongly Recommended) [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

## Getting Started

```sh
pnpm dlx plasmo init
# OR npm v7
npm x plasmo init
```

![Plasmo project files](/screenshots/file_structure.png)

This command will set up the simplest Plasmo browser extension project for you. The structure is straightforward:

| File name         | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `popup.tsx`       | This file exports default a React component, which gets rendered into your popup page. _This is all you need to work on your extension popup!_         |
| `assets`          | Plasmo automatically generates the smaller icons and applies them in the manifest for you from the "icon512.png" file                                  |
| `package.json`    | Your usual Node.js project descriptor, with [an optional "manifest" property to customize Plasmo to your need](/customization#overriding-the-manifest) |
| `.prettierrc.cjs` | For code styling consistency                                                                                                                           |
| `.gitignore`      | Your friendly neighborhood git ignore file                                                                                                             |
| `readme.md`       | Basic documentation                                                                                                                                    |
| `tsconfig.json`   | TypeScript configuration                                                                                                                               |

> **NOTE:** If you would like to use the `src` directory for your source code (`tsx` and `ts`), please make sure to follow this [guide](/customization#using-src-directory-for-source-code).

### Building

For live-reloading support, you can build a development version with

```sh
pnpm dev
```

This will create a built version of the extension in `build/chrome-mv3-dev`

For a production build,

```sh
pnpm build
```

This will create a built version of the extension in `build/chrome-mv3-prod`

### Loading the Extension in Chrome

We plan to automate this in the future, but for the time being, these are the steps you need to take to load your extension in Chrome.

Head over to `chrome://extensions` and enable Developer Mode.

![](/screenshots/developer_mode.png)

Click on "Load Unpacked" and navigate to your extension's `build/chrome-mv3-dev` (or `build/chrome-mv3-prod`) directory.

To see your popup, click on the puzzle piece icon on the Chrome toolbar, and click on your extension.

**Pro tip:** you can pin your extension to the Chrome toolbar for easy access by clicking the pin button.

## Where is the manifest.json file?

It will be generated on-the-fly for you. Plasmo generates the manifest based on the source files you create and configurations you export from your code - similar to how [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) abstracts page routing and SSG with the file system and page components.

We will further abstract with auto-permissions and a needs-based permission scheme, removing the need to specify permissions manually! _(Coming soon)_

## Next Steps

Check out the [Workflows section](./workflows) for a deep dive on how to work with Plasmo. A modular example accompanies each workflow, showcasing the framework's simplicity. View examples on [our GitHub repo](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples).

Check out the [Customization section](./customization) for documentation on making Plasmo adapt to your needs.

To see how to integrate Plasmo with other tools (such as TailwindCSS or Firebase), check out the list of examples in the [Quickstarts section](./quickstarts).

## Community

You can find the Plasmo community on [Discord](https://www.plasmo.com/s/d). This is the appropriate channel to get help with using the Plasmo Framework.
