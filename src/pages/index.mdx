# Introduction to Plasmo

<ShieldBanners socialOnly />

Welcome to Plasmo, the all-in-one platform that makes it easy for browser extension developers to create, test, and publish amazing extensions. With Plasmo, you can say goodbye to tedious boilerplate code and hello to a faster, more seamless development experience.

Our flagship product, the [Plasmo Framework](#plasmo-framework), is the ultimate Browser Extension SDK. It's designed to help you write extension code quickly and easily, without worrying about the intricacies of browser extensions.

Once you've built your extension, use [Itero TestBed](#itero-testbed) to test it in a real-world environment. This powerful staging environment lets you see how your extension will perform in the wild, and make any necessary changes before you launch. Ship directly to your beta testers without a review process holding you back.

Finally, when you're ready to go live, our [Plasmo BPP tool](#plasmo-browser-platform-publisher) makes it easy to automate the publishing process. With just a few clicks, you can publish your extension to the world and start gaining users.

Thanks to Plasmo, developing extensions has never been easier. Try it out today and see the difference for yourself!

## Plasmo Framework

Imagine a world where building browser extensions is easy and fun. Gone are the days of tedious development processes and struggling with complex APIs and configurations.

With Plasmo, declarative development is a breeze - just write a file, export a component, and Plasmo does the rest, automatically bundling and mounting it for you. Plus, [our active community](https://www.plasmo.com/s/d) of over 400 developers is always there to help out and share their expertise.

Plasmo offers first-class support for Typescript, React, Preact, Svelte, and Vue, making it easy to build complex, beautiful and scalable extensions. And with live-reload and React HMR built-in, you can see your changes instantly, without having to manually refresh your extension.

Plasmo also comes with powerful libraries for [storage](/framework/storage) and [messaging](/framework/messaging), as well as built-in support for [.env files](/framework/env). Plus, with Plasmo's "learn once, write everywhere" approach, you can build an extension once and easily [target it to multiple browsers and manifest versions](/framework/workflows/build#with-a-specific-target).
