# Extension Icon

The Plasmo framework automatically generates smaller resolution versions of the icon for the built bundle. Thus, all you need to work on is the high-fidelity version!

By default, it processes the `assets/icon.png` file for the extension icon. Optionally, it also supports the following names instead of `icon`:

| icon512  | icon-512  | icon-512x512   |
| -------- | --------- | -------------- |
| icon1024 | icon-1024 | icon-1024x1024 |

The alternative name is helpful to clarify the size of the original icon. However, only one file will be picked by the framework. Ensure it is inside the `assets` directory and is a PNG file with `.png` extension.

## Development Icon

In [development mode](/workflows/dev), Plasmo grayscales the icon to help distinguish it from the production bundle:

## Custom Development Icon

To override the grayscale behavior, you can place an `icon.development.png` file in the `assets` directory. Plasmo will use this file instead of the `icon.png` file in development mode.

## Icon Sizes

Plasmo generates the following icon sizes:

| 16x16 | 48x48 | 64x64 | 32x32 | 128x128 |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- |

Developers can specify a custom icon for each size by placing a file with any of the following names in the `assets` directory:

- icon16.png
- icon-16.png
- icon-16x16.png

It's also possible to override the development version of each size by placing file any of these names:

- icon16.development.png
- icon-16.development.png
- icon-16x16.development.png
