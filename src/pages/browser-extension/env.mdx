# Environment Variables

## Built-in Environment Variables

Plasmo framework provides the following built-in client-side environment variables:

- `NODE_ENV`: Either `development` or `production`
- `PLASMO_TARGET`: The specified target, e.g. `chrome-mv3`
- `PLASMO_BROWSER`: The name of the target browser, e.g. `chrome`
- `PLASMO_MANIFEST_VERSION`: The manifest version, e.g. `mv3`

## Custom Environment Variables

To add environment variables accessible to the extension, create a `.env` file:

```ini
PLASMO_PUBLIC_SHIP_NAME=ncc-1701
PLASMO_PUBLIC_SHIELD_FREQUENCY=42

PRIVATE_KEY=xxx
```

Only environment variables prefixed with `PLASMO_PUBLIC_` will be exposed in the built extension bundle.

## Usage in Source Code

Use them in any of your extension's source files:

```tsx
// For TSX (popups, option page):
const FrontHull = () => <h1>{process.env.PLASMO_PUBLIC_SHIP_NAME}</h1>

// For TS (content scripts or background-scripts):
const shield = new Shield(process.env.PLASMO_PUBLIC_SHIELD_FREQUENCY)

// Will be undefined
console.log(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY)
```

To override a variable in the production build with `plasmo build`, supply a `.env.production` file. Since Plasmo cascades .env files, only specify the variable to replace.

To enjoy Typescript IntelliSense with your environment variables, create an `index.d.ts` file:

```ts
declare namespace NodeJS {
  interface ProcessEnv {
    PLASMO_PUBLIC_SHIP_NAME?: string
    PLASMO_PUBLIC_SHIELD_FREQUENCY?: number
  }
}
```

See [with-env-files](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-env-files) for more details about using .env variables.

## Usage in Remote Code Import

Use public environment variables if you are [importing remote code](/browser-extension/remote-code):

```tsx
import "https://www.plasmo.com/js?id=$PLASMO_PUBLIC_ITERO"
```

## Usage in Content Scripts Config

You can also use environment variables in the [content script config exports](/browser-extension/content-scripts#customizing-content-script-config):

```ts
export const config: PlasmoContentScript = {
  matches: ["$PLASMO_PUBLIC_SITE_URL/"]
}
```

## Usage in Manifest Overrides

Plasmo lets you [override the final generated extension manifest via the `manifest` property of the package.json file](/customization/manifest). Taking one step further, Plasmo also parses any environment variables used in the manifest overrides:

```json
"manifest": {
  "key": "$CRX_PUBLIC_KEY"
}
```

You can use public (prefixed with `PLASMO_PUBLIC`) and private environment variables in your manifest override. ðŸ˜Ž

> **NOTE:** Plasmo will omit the key if it can't find the environment variable.

## Development-only environment variables

Sometimes, you might want some environment variables strictly for development. Environment-specific files only inject into their environments and don't cascade:

- `.env.development`
- `.env.production`

If there is a `CRX_PUBLIC_KEY` environment variable in `.env.development` but not in `.env.production` or `.env`, it will be available in `plasmo dev` but not `plasmo build`.

## Local namespaced environment variables

Plasmo also supports the following environment file names (Next.js developers will find these familiar):

- `.env.local`
- `.env.production.local`
- `.env.development.local`

Files with `.local` at the end of their names have a higher priority than the non-local ones. `.env.local` has higher priority than `.env.production` and `.env.development`. Within the same namespace, however, the cascading order is as expected. This feature utilizes a cascading/overriding strategy for environment variables using the [`dotenv` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).
