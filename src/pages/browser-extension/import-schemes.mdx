# Import Resolution

To import data into extension code Plasmo introduces several "import scheme" that you can use. A scheme is similar to a protocol but instead for a URL, it is for a file path. The scheme is prefixed to the file path and separated by a colon. For example, `data-base64:~/assets/image.png` is a valid import path.

## Paths

### Tilde (`~`)

### Relative (`./`)

### Absolute (`/`)

## Schemes

### url

### raw

### raw-env

### data-base64

### data-env

### data-text

### data-text-env
