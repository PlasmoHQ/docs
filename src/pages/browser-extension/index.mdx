# Extension Pages

Extension pages are built-in pages recognized by the browser. They include the extension's popup, options, and newtab pages.

## Adding a Popup Page

The Popup Page is a small dialog window that opens when the user clicks on the extension's icon in the browser toolbar. It is the most common type of extension page.

Create a `popup.tsx` file or a `popup/index.tsx` file that exports a default React component. With that, your popup is ready to be used ðŸš€!

See [with-popup](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-popup)

## Adding the Options UI

The Option UI page aims to provide a dedicated place for the extension's setting and configuration.

Create either an `options.tsx` or `options/index.tsx` file to render the options_ui ðŸ‘Œ

See [with-options](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-options-ui)

## Adding a New Tab Page

The New Tab page overrides the default tab and is generally how the browser greets the user.

Create a `newtab.tsx` file or a `newtab/index.tsx` file, and Plasmo will take care of the rest to render your new tab page ðŸ¤˜!
