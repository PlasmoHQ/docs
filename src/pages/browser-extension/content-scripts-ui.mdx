# Content Scripts UI

Plasmo has first-class support for mounting React, Svelte3, or Vue3 components into the current webpage. This feature is called content scripts UI (CSUI).

An extension can have as many CSUI as needed, with each CSUI targeting a group of webpages or a specific webpage by [exporting the config object](/browser-extension/content-scripts#config). To start injecting UI using React:

0. Create a `contents` directory if you don't have one already.
1. Create a new file inside the `contents` directory with a `.tsx` extension: `contents/inline.tsx`
2. Export a default React component:

```tsx
const PlasmoInline = () => {
  return <button>Custom button</button>
}

export default PlasmoInline
```

3. Profit 🎉

> NOTE: If you'd only like to have one content script UI, instead of creating a contents/ directory, you can have a file named `content.tsx` in your project's root directory.

See [with-content-scripts-ui](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-content-scripts-ui) for a full example.

### How does Plasmo mount the UI component?

Plasmo creates a [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) and mounts your exported component onto it. This isolation technique prevents the web page's style from affecting the component's styling.

### Config

Content scripts UI are a subset of content scripts. Thus, you can [export a config object](/browser-extension/content-scripts#config) just as you would a regular Plasmo content script.

## getStyle

To inject stylesheets into your content script UI's Shadow DOM, export a `getStyle` function that returns a valid [`HTMLElement.style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/style) element:

```ts
import cssText from "data-text:~/contents/plasmo-overlay.css"

export const getStyle = () => {
  const style = document.createElement("style")
  style.textContent = cssText
  return style
}
```

Plasmo adds the style element into the Shadow DOM before the exported component's container.

See [the plasmo-overlay.tsx file in with-content-scripts-ui](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/blob/main/with-content-scripts-ui/contents/plasmo-overlay.tsx) for an example.

### Note about `data-text` schemes

In the example above, we use the [`data-text`](/browser-extension/import#data-text) scheme to load our stylesheet as plain text into the `cssText` variable, which we then assign to our style element's `textContent`. 

> NOTE: Be cautious with this scheme's import path if you use the `src` directory, as noted [here](/browser-extension/import#tilde-).

### Styling the shadows

Use the IDs `#plasmo-mount-container` and `#plasmo-shadow-container` to tweak the ShadowDOM containers' styles in your CSS:

```css
#plasmo-shadow-container {
  z-index: 99999;
}

#plasmo-mount-container {
  background: blue;
}
```

### Using a custom font

To use a custom font in your CSUI, you must import the font inside a CSS file and declare it in the `css` property of the [config object](/browser-extension/content-scripts#config). The browser does not recognize Font assets if declared inside a shadowDOM. You have to load them in the global scope.

1. Add your font in the `assets` directory (e.g `/assets/Fascinate.woff2`)
2. Create a `font.css` file, importing the font inline using the [`data-base64`](/browser-extension/import#data-base64) scheme:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Fascinate";
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-display: swap;
  src: url(data-base64:~assets/Fascinate.woff2) format("woff2");
  unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02BB-02BC, U+02C6, U+02DA,
    U+02DC, U+2000-206F, U+2074, U+20AC, U+2122, U+2191, U+2193, U+2212, U+2215,
    U+FEFF, U+FFFD;
}
```

3. Declare the file in the `css` property of the config:

```tsx
export const config: PlasmoContentScript = {
  matches: ["https://www.plasmo.com/*"],
  css: ["font.css"]
}
```

Once the browser registers the font, you can reference it inside your CSS style:

```css
.hw-top {
  background: red;
  color: white;
  font-family: "Fascinate";
}
```

See [with-content-scripts-ui/contents/plasmo-overlay.tsx](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/blob/main/with-content-scripts-ui/contents/plasmo-overlay.tsx) for a full example.

## getOverlayAnchor

To anchor a React component on top of a specific element on the current webpage, export a function called `getOverlayAnchor` that returns a valid [`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement):

```tsx
import type { PlasmoGetOverlayAnchor } from "plasmo"

export const getOverlayAnchor: PlasmoGetOverlayAnchor = async () =>
  document.querySelector("#element")
```

Plasmo overlays your exported component onto the returned element.

Since the `getOverlayAnchor` function is async, you also have the power to control *when* Plasmo mounts your component. For example, you can wait for a specific element to appear on the page before mounting your component.

Check [this file in with-content-scripts-ui](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/blob/main/with-content-scripts-ui/contents/plasmo-mount.tsx) for an example.

### How does the getOverlayAnchor work?

`getOverlayAnchor` first listens to the current window's scroll event. On each scroll event, it uses the `getBoundingClientRect` function to calculate the absolute position of the target element. Then, it applies the calculated position to the container used to mount your component.

### watchOverlayAnchor

If you don't want to wait for the scroll event to fire, you can use the `watchOverlayAnchor` function to change how Plasmo triggers the overlaying process. The example below refreshes the position every 8472ms:

```ts
import type { PlasmoWatchOverlayAnchor } from "plasmo"

export const watchOverlayAnchor: PlasmoWatchOverlayAnchor = (
  updatePosition
) => {
  setInterval(() => {
    updatePosition()
  }, 8472)
}
```

## getInlineAnchor

To anchor a React component next to another element on the webpage, export a function called `getInlineAnchor` that returns a valid [`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement):

```tsx
import type { PlasmoGetInlineAnchor } from "plasmo"

export const getInlineAnchor: PlasmoGetInlineAnchor = () =>
  document.querySelector("#supercharge > h2 > span")
```

Plasmo will inline your exported component next to the returned element.

> NOTE: `getInlineAnchor` must be synchronous since Plasmo invokes it inside a MutationObserver that watches over the entire web page's DOM. Plasmo's observer instance will monitor the shadow host to re-mount it as needed.

### How does getInlineAnchor detect if my component is mounted?

If you provide a [shadowHostId](#getshadowhostid), Plasmo will query it using `document.getElementById` on every observer callback. Otherwise, Plasmo will use `getRootNode`, which traces the DOM tree upwards until it finds the root node and compares it to the page's root document.

## getShadowHostId

Sometimes, you might want to make runtime changes to the shadow host. By exporting a `getShadowHostId` function (optionally async), you can assign the shadow host's DOM ID, which will allow you to select and modify it:

```tsx
import type { PlasmoGetShadowHostId } from "plasmo"

export const getShadowHostId: PlasmoGetShadowHostId = () => "custom-shadow-host"
```

This will also optimize the performance of the inline anchor function since it will no longer need to traverse the DOM tree upwards to find the root node.

## mountShadowHost

Your component lives inside a container called a `shadowHost`.

By default, Plasmo will mount the `shadowHost` after the element you returned in `getInlineAnchor`. If you want to customize how Plasmo should mount the `shadowHost`, export a `mountShadowHost` function.

The example below adds the `shadowHost` as a child of the inlineAnchor instead of being siblings:

```tsx
import type { PlasmoMountShadowHost } from "plasmo"

export const mountShadowHost: PlasmoMountShadowHost = ({
  shadowHost,
  inlineAnchor
}) => {
  inlineAnchor.appendChild(shadowHost)
}
```

The `mountShadowHost` function also receives the observer instance, allowing you to stop the observer as needed:

```tsx
import type { PlasmoMountShadowHost } from "plasmo"

export const mountShadowHost: PlasmoMountShadowHost = ({
  shadowHost,
  inlineAnchor,
  observer
}) => {
  // Do you custom mount...
  inlineAnchor.appendChild(shadowHost)
  observer.disconnect()
}
```

## createShadowRoot

By default, Plasmo creates an "open" `shadowRoot` and attaches it to the `shadowHost`. To override this behavior and customize your `shadowRoot`, export a `createShadowRoot` function. The first parameter is the generated `shadowHost`.

The following example customizes the `shadowRoot` to be "closed":

```tsx
import type { PlasmoCreateShadowRoot } from "plasmo"

export const createShadowRoot: PlasmoCreateShadowRoot = (shadowHost) =>
  shadowHost.attachShadow({ mode: "closed" })
```

## getRootContainer

Sometimes, you'll want to completely replace Plasmo's Shadow DOM container implementation to fit your needs better. To do so, export a `getRootContainer` function that returns a valid [`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement):

```ts
export const getRootContainer = () => {
  return document.querySelector("#feature")
}
```

Use cases:

- Extension needs to [absorb the styling of the host webpage](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/plasmo/issues/10#issuecomment-1149499252)
- Extension needs to mount the component directly into the webpage instead of using a shadow DOM
- Extension needs to use an [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe](iframe), instead


> **NOTE:** If you export a `getRootContainer` function, Plasmo ignores the `getStyle` function since only the provided Shadow DOM container uses it. `getMountPoint`'s behavior might also be affected as the component's position will be relative to your provided container.

Check [this file in with-content-scripts-ui](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/blob/main/with-content-scripts-ui/contents/plasmo-root-container.tsx) for an example.

## render

The `render` function allows you to customize how Plasmo renders everything. Use it to override our implementation of the MutationObserver, our MountContainer, or both:

```ts
import type { PlasmoRender } from "plasmo"

export const render: PlasmoRender = (
  createRootContainer, // This creates the default root container
  MountContainer // This creates the default MountContainer
) => {
  const rootContainer = await createRootContainer()

  const soup = cookRoot(rootContainer)
  soup.render(<MountContainer />)
}
```
