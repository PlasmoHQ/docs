# Content Script UI

Plasmo has first-class support for mounting React, Svelte3, or Vue3 components into the current webpage. This feature is called content scripts UI (CSUI).

An extension can have as many CSUI as needed, with each CSUI targeting a group of webpages or a specific webpage by [exporting the config object](/workflows/content-scripts#customizing-content-script-config). To start injecting UI using React:

0. Create a `contents` directory if you don't have one already.
1. Create a new file inside `contents` directory with the `.tsx` extension: `contents/inline.tsx`
2. Export default a React component:

```tsx
const PlasmoInline = () => {
  return <button>Custom button</button>
}

export default PlasmoInline
```

3. Profit ðŸŽ‰

> NOTE: It works with a `content.tsx` at the source code directory as well.

### How does Plasmo mount the React component?

Plasmo creates a [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) and mounts the React component to it. This isolation technique prevents the web page's style from affecting the component's styling.

## getOverlayAnchor

To anchor a React component on top of a specific element on the current webpage, export a function called `getOverlayAnchor` that returns a valid [`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement):

```ts
export const getMountPoint = async () => document.querySelector("#element")
```

This function is asynchronous, which allows you to wait until the element exists. It is also agnostic. You can send the current webpage to a remote API via fetch to calculate the element selector, then query and return that element. The possibilities are endless!

Check [this file in with-content-scripts-ui](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/blob/main/with-content-scripts-ui/contents/plasmo-mount.tsx) for an example.

### How does getOverlayAnchor works?

`getOverlayAnchor` first listens to the current window's scroll event. On each scroll event, it uses the `getBoundingClientRect` function to calculate the absolute position of the target element. Then, it applies the calculated position to the container used to mount your component.

## watchOverlayAnchor

This method allows the developer to refresh the overlay position as needed to realign with its anchor. It passes down an `updatePosition` callback for the developer to call upon detecting any changes that requires re-positioning of the overlay.

## getInlineAnchor

To anchor a React component inline with a specific element on the current webpage, export a function called `getInlineAnchor` that returns a valid [`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement):

```tsx
export const getInlineAnchor: PlasmoGetInlineAnchor = () =>
  document.querySelector("#supercharge > h2 > span")
```

Inline anchor function must be synchronous.

## getShadowHostId

There are cases when we might want to make run-time change to the shadow host. By exporting a `getShadowHostId` function (optionally async), we can assign the shadow host's DOM ID, which will allow us to select and modify it:

```ts
export const getShadowHostId = () => "custom-shadow-host"
```

## mountShadowHost

## createShadowRoot

## getStyle

To inject stylesheets into your content script UI's Shadow DOM, export a `getStyle` function that returns a valid [`HTMLElement.style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/style) element:

```ts
import cssText from "data-text:~/contents/plasmo-overlay.css"

export const getStyle = () => {
  const style = document.createElement("style")
  style.textContent = cssText
  return style
}
```

Plasmo appends the style element into the Shadow DOM before the exported component's container.

See [the plasmo-overlay.tsx file in with-content-scripts-ui](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/blob/main/with-content-scripts-ui/contents/plasmo-overlay.tsx) for an example.

### Note about `data-text` schemes

In the example above, we use the `data-text` scheme to load our stylesheet as plain text into the `cssText` variable, which we then assign to our style element's `textContent`. Be cautious with this scheme's import path if you use the `src` directory, as noted [here](/workflows/faq#tilde-import-resolution).

## Styling the built-in shadow containers

Use the ids `#plasmo-mount-container` and `#plasmo-shadow-container` to tweak the style of these shadowDOM containers in your css:

```css
#plasmo-shadow-container {
  z-index: 99999;
}

#plasmo-mount-container {
  background: blue;
}
```

## getRootContainer

To replace the Shadow DOM, export a `getRootContainer` function that returns a valid [`HTMLElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement).

Use cases:

- Extension needs to [absorb the styling of the host webpage](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/plasmo/issues/10#issuecomment-1149499252)
- Extension needs to mount the component directly into the webpage instead of having an overlay shadow DOM

```ts
export const getRootContainer = () => {
  return document.querySelector("#feature")
}
```

> **NOTE:** If you export a `getRootContainer` function, Plasmo ignores the `getStyle` function since only the provided Shadow DOM container uses it. `getMountPoint`'s behavior might also be affected as the component's position will be relative to your provided container.

Check [this file in with-content-scripts-ui](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/blob/main/with-content-scripts-ui/contents/plasmo-root-container.tsx) for an example.
