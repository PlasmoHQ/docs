## Tilde Import Resolution

When used outside a source code module or with a scheme such as `data-base64`, `data-text`, or `url`, the tilde (`~`) **always** resolves to the project's root directory where the `package.json` resides. Thus:

- `~rulesets/test.json` used in the [manifest overide inside `package.json`](/customization/manifest) resolves to `/rulesets/test.json`
- `data-base64:~assets/image.png` resolves to `/assets/image.png`
- `url:~src/code.js` resolves to `/src/code.js.`

If the tilde is by itself without a scheme and is being used to import a source code module from another source code module (`ts` or `tsx` files), it has two behaviors depending on whether you are using the default setup or the [the `src` directory setup](/customization/src):

- With the default setup, `~` points to the project root.
- With the `src` directory setup, `~` points to the `src` directory. Thus `~core/code-module.tsx`, resolves to `/src/core/code-module.tsx`.
