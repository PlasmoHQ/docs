# Workflows Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I update Plasmo to the latest version?

If you use pnpm, run:

```sh
pnpm up -L plasmo
```

For other package managers, you will need to purge the lock file and rerun the install subcommand to get the latest version of Plasmo.

Alternatively, you can manually pin Plasmo's version by upgrading its version number in `package.json` and running the install subcommand afterward.

## What should I do if an error occurs?

Please run plasmo with the `--verbose` flag and paste the output in the log section of a [bug report](/bug). That will help us triage the issue 100x faster üôè

## What are the officially supported browser targets?

Officially supported targets are:

- `chrome-mv3` (default)
- `firefox-mv2`

Any chromium-based browser (e.g. Edge, Brave, Opera, etc.) should work, e.g:

- `edge-mv3`
- `brave-mv3`
- `opera-mv3`

We are working to support `safari-mv3` soon. See [this issue](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/plasmo/issues/233)
