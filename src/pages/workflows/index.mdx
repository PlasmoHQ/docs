# Create a New Extension

<Callout emoji="📢">

**NOTE:** To use the `src` directory for the source code module, please follow this
[guide](/customization/src).

</Callout>

To run the interactive initialization wizard, use the following command:

```sh
pnpm create plasmo
# OR
yarn create plasmo
# OR
npm create plasmo
```

To skip the naming prompt, supply a name as a positional argument:

```sh
pnpm create plasmo "My Awesome Extension"
# OR
yarn create plasmo "My Awesome Extension"
# OR
npm create plasmo "My Awesome Extension"
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="⭐">

**NOTE:** you can install the plasmo CLI as a global command with `pnpm i -g plasmo` (switch `pnpm` with your favorite package manager).

</Callout>

## With specific entry files

The default project contains just a [popup](browser-extension#adding-a-popup-page) entry file. However, you can customize this behavior by using the `entry` parameter with a comma-separated list of entry files to include in your initial project.

To see every available entry file, check [this directory](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/plasmo/tree/main/packages/init/entries).

To use this flag, pick the entry files you would like to see in your project, omit its extension, and supply it to the `--entry` flag:

```sh
pnpm create plasmo --entry=options,newtab,contents/inline
# OR
npm create plasmo -- --entry=options,newtab,contents/inline
```

The command above will create a project with the [options page](browser-extension#adding-the-options-ui), a [newtab page](browser-extension#adding-a-new-tab-page), and an [inline content script UI]().

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">

**NOTE**: `npm` does not pass arguments down to its child command. Thus, you must supply a `--` to escape `npm` before specifying plasmo's parameters and flags.

</Callout>

## With an example template

Even more powerful, Plasmo can create a new project based on a project in [our examples](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/). Pick an example you would like to use, and use it as a flag when running the `create plasmo` command:

```sh
pnpm create plasmo --with-env
# OR
npm create plasmo -- --with-env
```

The above will generate a project using the [with-env](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-env) example under the name you will provide.

## Loading the extension

We plan to automate this in the future, but for the time being, these are the steps you need to take to load your extension in Chrome.

Head over to `chrome://extensions` and enable Developer Mode.

Click on "Load Unpacked" and navigate to your extension's `build/chrome-mv3-dev` (or `build/chrome-mv3-prod`) directory.

To see your popup, click on the puzzle piece icon on the Chrome toolbar, and click on your extension.

**Pro tip:** Pin your extension to the Chrome toolbar for easy access by clicking the pin button.
