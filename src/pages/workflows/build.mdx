# Create a Production Build

To create a production bundle for distribution, run:

```sh
pnpm build
# OR
npm run build
```

## Generating a zip bundle

Optionally supply a `--zip` flag to the build command to create a zip bundle ready to be uploaded to the web stores:

```sh
pnpm build --zip
# OR
npm run build -- --zip
```

## With a specific target

The `build` command accepts a `--target` flag. Use it to specify a browser and manifest version combination to build for:

```sh
plasmo build --target=firefox-mv2
```

The final bundle will be available in the `build/firefox-mv2-prod` directory.

For a list of officially supported targets, [view our officially supported browser targets section](./faq#what-are-the-officially-supported-browser-targets).

## With source maps

By default, Plasmo does not generate source maps for your production bundle. However, you can use the `--source-maps` flag to change this behavior:

```sh
plasmo build --source-maps
```
