# Quickstart with Google Analytics

Since Manifest V3 does not support [remote code execution](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-overview/#remotely-hosted-code), it has been very difficult for developer to integrate google analytics into their extension project, especially with the latest [gtag4 version](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4).

To overcome this issue, Plasmo [bundles remote code at build time](/workflows/remote-code).

## Obtaining the Tracking/Measurement ID

To get the Tracking ID, you will first need to create a property. During this process, you will be asked to provide a website URL - we suggest providing a subdomain of a domain that you own. This ensure the data coming in is only from your properties - website/domain/extension.

> NOTE: You can actually reuse any property you owned (for example, the website property that you use to market your extension).

Then, to get the Measurement ID, visit your Google Analytics dashboard, and navigate to the Tagging Instructions section (Admin -> Setup Assistant -> Tag installation -> Data Streams -> Web):

Click the button next to the Measurement ID, and that should copy it to your clipboard.

## Env Variable Setup

To properly store the Measurement ID, we recommend using [environment variables](/workflows/env). Create an `.env.local` file:

`.env.local`

```
PLASMO_PUBLIC_GTAG_ID=<paste in your measurement ID>
```

To get TypeScript intellisense, create an `index.d.ts` file:

`index.d.ts`

```ts
declare namespace NodeJS {
  interface ProcessEnv {
    PLASMO_PUBLIC_GTAG_ID?: string
  }
}

interface Window {
  dataLayer: Array
  gtag: (a: string, b: any, c?: any) => void
}
```

## Using Google Analytics in a React component

Below is an example of how to implement the google tag tracking script in the popup page:

```tsx
import "https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=$PLASMO_PUBLIC_GTAG_ID"
import { useEffect, useState } from "react"

function IndexPopup() {
  const [data, setData] = useState("")

  useEffect(() => {
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []
    window.gtag = function gtag() {
      window.dataLayer.push(arguments) // eslint-disable-line
    }
    window.gtag("js", new Date())
    window.gtag("config", process.env.PLASMO_PUBLIC_GTAG_ID, {
      page_path: "/popup",
      debug_mode: true
    })

    window.gtag("event", "login", {
      method: "TEST"
    })
  }, [])

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: "flex",
        flexDirection: "column",
        padding: 16
      }}>
      <h1>
        Welcome to your <a href="https://www.plasmo.com">Plasmo</a> Extension!
      </h1>
      <input onChange={(e) => setData(e.target.value)} value={data} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default IndexPopup
```

The import statement and the code inside the `useEffect` is identical to what Google gives you (see image below). We simply adapted them into the React lifecycle. The `window` object is added to make it work with Typescript.
