# Quickstart with Next.js

Plasmo seamlessly integrates with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The key idea is that Plasmo is your extension's entry point, and Next.js is your web application's entry point, allowing you to reuse your component across your codebase with minor adjustments.

List of compatibilities:

- The TypeScript configuration exposed by Plasmo is compatible with Next.js, including the ability to use the `src` directory.
- The [.env file](/framework/env) is the same, but uses a different namespace (`PLASMO_PUBLIC` vs `NEXT_PUBLIC`)
- Plasmo uses [Parcel 2](https://parceljs.org/) which uses [swc](https://swc.rs/) underneath - the same bundler that Next.js uses. Thus, you can share plugin configs such as postcss and tailwindcss without modification.

See [with-nextjs](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-nextjs) for an example!
