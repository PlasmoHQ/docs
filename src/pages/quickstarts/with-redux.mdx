# Quickstart with Redux

Easily integrate Redux to provide a simple way to manage state across your browser extension.

We maintain a custom fork of [redux-persist](https://github.com/plasmo-foss/redux-persist) which you can utilize along with [redux-persist-webextension-storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-persist-webextension-storage) to persist your Redux state using `chrome.storage`.

Just a heads up, the current version does not support content scripts. If you'd like content script support, [please file an issue](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/issues), and we will prioritize adding that functionality.

## Increment Example

Let's make a basic extension that increments and decrements a counter.

### Create Your Slice

```ts filename="counter-slice.ts"
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"

export interface CounterState {
  count: number
}

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: { count: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      state.count += 1
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.count -= 1
    }
  }
})

export const { increment, decrement } = counterSlice.actions

export default counterSlice.reducer
```

### Create Your Store

```ts filename="store.ts"
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
import { localStorage } from "redux-persist-webextension-storage"

import {
  FLUSH,
  PAUSE,
  PERSIST,
  PURGE,
  REGISTER,
  REHYDRATE,
  RESYNC,
  persistReducer,
  persistStore
} from "@plasmohq/redux-persist"
import { Storage } from "@plasmohq/storage"

import counterSlice from "~counter-slice"

const rootReducer = counterSlice

const persistConfig = {
  key: "root",
  version: 1,
  storage: localStorage
}

const persistedReducer = persistReducer(persistConfig, rootReducer)

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: persistedReducer,
  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) =>
    getDefaultMiddleware({
      serializableCheck: {
        ignoredActions: [
          FLUSH,
          REHYDRATE,
          PAUSE,
          PERSIST,
          PURGE,
          REGISTER,
          RESYNC
        ]
      }
    })
})
export const persistor = persistStore(store)

// This is what makes Redux sync properly with multiple pages
// Open your extension's options page and popup to see it in action
new Storage().watch({
  [`persist:${persistConfig.key}`]: () => {
    persistor.resync()
  }
})
```

The thing to note is the `new Storage().watch()` call. This will automatically resync the store whenever the Redux store changes in `chrome.storage`.

### Using in React

```tsx filename="options.tsx"
import { Provider } from "react-redux"

import { PersistGate } from "@plasmohq/redux-persist/integration/react"

import { CounterView } from "~counter"
import { persistor, store } from "~store"

function Options() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <PersistGate loading={null} persistor={persistor}>
        <CounterView />
      </PersistGate>
    </Provider>
  )
}

export default Options
```

Using the `PersistGate` will ensure the child components don't render until the store is ready.

### Using in a Background Service Worker

```ts filename="background.ts"
import { persistor, store } from "~store"

persistor.subscribe(() => {
  console.log("State changed with: ", store?.getState())
})
```
