title: Customize Your Browser Extension's Manifest
description: Plasmo handles most of your manifest for you, but sometimes you'll want to add your own config. This guide will show you how.

# Overriding the Manifest

Plasmo will pass over the following fields from the `package.json` to the generated extension manifest:

- `packageJson.version` -> `manifest.version`
- `packageJson.displayName` -> `manifest.name`
- `packageJson.description` -> `manifest.description`
- `packageJson.author` -> `manifest.author`
- `packageJson.homepage` -> `manifest.homepage_url`

The Plasmo Framework extends the `package.json` with a `manifest` field to override the generated extension manifest. The primary use case is to enable features that the Plasmo framework does not _yet_ natively support.

For instance, the Plasmo Framework might not understand that you need to have an `activeTab` permission. You'll need to modify your project's `package.json` like so:

```json
...
"manifest": {
    "permissions": [
        "activeTab"
    ]
}
```

## Using environment variables

You can use environment variables inside the manifest overrides. For instance in the [with-storage example](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/blob/main/with-storage/package.json):

```json
"manifest": {
  "browser_specific_settings": {
    "gecko": {
      "id": "$FIREFOX_EXT_ID"
    }
  }
}
```

## Using locale template string

You can use locale template strings in the manifest overrides:

```json
"manifest": {
  "name": "__MSG_extensionName__"
}
```
