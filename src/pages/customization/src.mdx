# Using the `src` directory for source code

Instead of having your source code in the root directory, you can put it in a child `src` directory.

For TypeScript to work correctly, you will need to point the resolved `paths` for the `~*` prefix in the `tsconfig.json` file to `"./src/*"`.

The new configuration looks like this:

```json
{
  "extends": "plasmo/templates/tsconfig.base",
  "exclude": ["node_modules"],
  "include": [".plasmo/**/*", "./**/*.ts", "./**/*.tsx"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "~*": ["./src/*"]
    },
    "baseUrl": "."
  }
}
```

Please ensure that **ALL source files** (including Plasmo's entry files such as `popup.tsx`, `options.tsx`, `background.ts`, etc.) are in the `src` directory. Otherwise, Plasmo will not know where to find the entry files, which will result in an empty extension!

> **NOTE:** This customization only resolves `~` to `/src` for source code files with `tsx` and `ts` extension. Please see this note about [asset resolving](/browser-extension/faq#tilde-import-resolution).
