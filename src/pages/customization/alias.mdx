# Alias Source Code Import

Plasmo supports an `alias` property in the `package.json` file to map an import specifier to a local directory or another node package.

## Alias Local Imports

Since Plasmo uses [parcel](https://parceljs.org), which uses [swc](https://swc.rs/) underneath, it does not do type-checking with TypeScript, effectively skipping the `tsconfig` path mapping. Thus, when working with custom paths in Typescript, you must specify the mapping twice:

1. In `package.json`'s `alias` field for the bundling process:

```json
{
  "alias": {
    "@Components": "./src/components/index.tsx"
  }
}
```

2. In `tsconfig.json`'s paths field for editor type-checking:

```json
{
  "extends": "plasmo/templates/tsconfig.base",
  "exclude": ["node_modules"],
  "include": [".plasmo/**/*", "./**/*.ts", "./**/*.tsx"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "~*": ["./src/*"],
      "@Components": ["./src/components/index"]
    },
    "baseUrl": "."
  }
}
```

3. Use it in your code:

```tsx
import { Button, Checkbox, Input } from "@Components"
```

See the example in [bug-244-alias-local-imports](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/plasmo-test/tree/main/bug/bug-244-alias-local-imports)

Note that the alias config for local import is a **one-to-one mapping** between an import specifier and a local source code module. It does not support glob aliasing. Thus you must declare each alias individually if you want to split your import:

```json
  "alias": {
    "@Components/button": "./src/components/button.tsx",
    "@Components/input": "./src/components/input.tsx",
    "@Components/checkbox": "./src/components/checkbox.tsx",
  }
```

This is cumbersome and not recommended. The recommended use of `alias` is to point `@Components` at a sibling package module with a `package.json` file, which declares all the sub-components as its exports. For example:

```json
{
  "alias": {
    "@Components": "../../components"
  }
}
```

This would allow sub-path imports such as `@Components/button` to work as long as you declared them in the `components` package's entry file. Since Parcel does [tree shaking](https://parceljs.org/features/production/#tree-shaking), any `import` that's not used will be removed from the final bundle - just make sure your components are statically exported/imported.

For more info, see [#244](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/plasmo/issues/244).

## Alias External Files

You can use the alias field to map an import to a file external to your project:

```json
{
  "alias": {
    "some-cool-identifier/hello": "../../../cool-file.js"
  }
}
```

Make sure to also declare that import in a typescript `cool-file.d.ts` file:

```ts
declare module "some-cool-identifier/hello" {
  export const hello: string
}
```

And include that file in your tsconfig:

```json
{
  ...
  "include": [".plasmo/**/*", "./**/*.ts", "./**/*.tsx", "./cool-file.d.ts"]
}
```

Then you can use it in your code:

```tsx
import { hello } from "some-cool-identifier/hello"
```

## Using Preact instead of React

Since Preact's API is compatible with React, you can alias it like so:

```json
{
  "alias": {
    "react": "preact/compat",
    "react-dom": "preact/compat"
  }
}
```
