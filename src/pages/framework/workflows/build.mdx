# Create a Production Build

To create a production bundle for distribution, run:

```sh
pnpm build
# OR
npm run build
```

## Generating a zip bundle

To create a production zip bundle ready to be uploaded to the web stores, use the `package` subcommand:

```sh
pnpm package
# OR
npm run package
```

If you would like to combine the building and packaging process, use the `--zip` flag with the `build` command instead:

```sh
pnpm build --zip
# OR
npm run build -- --zip
```

## With a specific target

The `build` command accepts a `--target` flag. Use it to specify a browser and manifest version combination to build for:

```sh
plasmo build --target=firefox-mv2
```

The final bundle will be available in the `build/firefox-mv2-prod` directory.

For a list of officially supported targets, [visit this link](./faq#what-are-the-officially-supported-browser-targets).

## With a custom tag

Plasmo uses the `prod` tag for your production build. You can use the `--tag` flag to change this behavior:

```sh
plasmo build --tag=staging
```

The command above will:

- Create the bundle in the `build/chrome-mv3-staging` directory
- Set the `process.env.PLASMO_TAG` environment variables to `staging`
- Parse and prioritize [`.env.staging` or `.env.staging.local`](/framework/env#bundle-specific-env) if any exists

## With source maps

By default, Plasmo does not generate source maps for your production bundle. However, you can use the `--source-maps` flag to change this behavior:

```sh
plasmo build --source-maps
```
