# Workflows Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I update Plasmo to the latest version?

If you use pnpm, run:

```sh
pnpm up -L plasmo
```

For other package managers, you will need to purge the lock file and rerun the install command to get the latest version of Plasmo.

Alternatively, you can manually pin Plasmo's version by upgrading its version number in `package.json` and running the install command afterward.

## How do I use the experimental version of Plasmo?

Change the version of `plasmo` in `package.json` to `lab`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "plasmo": "lab"
  }
}
```

Then do `pnpm i` to install the version.

## What should I do if an error occurs?

Please run `plasmo` with the `--verbose` flag and paste the output in the log section of a [bug report](/bug). That will help us triage the issue 100x faster 🙏

```sh
plasmo --verbose
```

## What are the officially supported browser targets?

Officially supported targets are:

- `chrome-mv3` (default)
- `firefox-mv2`
- `firefox-mv3` (experimental)

Any chromium-based browser (e.g. Edge, Brave, Opera, etc.) should work, e.g:

- `edge-mv3`
- `brave-mv3`
- `opera-mv3`
- `safari-mv3` requires some workaround. See [this issue](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/plasmo/issues/233).

For the time being, if you'd like to build for Safari, you can target `safari-mv3` and use the [safari-web-extension-converter](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions/converting_a_web_extension_for_safari) to convert the extension to Safari.
