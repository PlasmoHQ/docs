description: How to build a development version of your browser extension.

# Start the Development Server

Once you've set up your project, start developing your extension by navigating to your project directory and running:

```sh
pnpm dev
# OR
npm run dev
# OR
plasmo dev
```

Plasmo will create a dev bundle for your extension and a live-reloading development server, automatically updating your extension bundle on file changes and reloading your browser on source code changes. It also prefixes the extension name with `DEV |` and makes the icon grayscale to distinguish between development and production bundles.

## With a specific target

The `dev` command accepts a `--target` flag. Use it to specify a browser and manifest version combination to develop for:

```sh
plasmo dev --target=firefox-mv2
```

The final bundle will be available in the `build/firefox-mv2-dev` directory.

For a list of officially supported targets, [visit this link](./faq#what-are-the-officially-supported-browser-targets).

## Without source maps

By default, Plasmo generates source maps for your extension during development. If you need to disable this, you can use the `--no-source-maps` flag:

```sh
plasmo dev --no-source-maps
```

This is useful when you have dependencies that don't play well with source maps.
