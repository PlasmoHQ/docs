# Storage API

<ShieldBanners packageName="@plasmohq/storage" />

`@plasmohq/storage` is a utility library from [plasmo](https://www.plasmo.com/) that abstracts the persistent storage API available to browser extensions. It falls back to localStorage when the extension storage API is unavailable, allowing for state sync between extension pages, content scripts, background service workers and web pages.

> This library will enable the `storage` permission automatically if used as a **dependencies** in a [Plasmo framework](https://docs.plasmo.com) project

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install @plasmohq/storage
```

The package exports the following modules, in both ESM and CJS format:

| Modules                    | Description                                   |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| `@plasmohq/storage`        | The base [Storage API](#storage)              |
| `@plasmohq/storage/secure` | The [SecureStorage API](#secure-storage)      |
| `@plasmohq/storage/hook`   | The [React Hook Storage API](#react-hook-api) |

## Usage Examples

- See [with-storage](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-storage) for an example of how to use this library to sync state between options and popups.
- See [with-redux](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-redux) for an example of how to use this library as your Redux persistent layer (crucial for MV3).
- See [MICE](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/mice) for an experimental use case of this library integrated with WebRTC to pipe messages between browsers via an extension.

## Storage

The base Storage API is designed to be easy to use. It is usable in every extension runtime such as background service workers, content scripts and extension pages.

Get/set data without the need to JSON.stringify/parse. As long as the data you are storing is serializable (plain object or of primitive type), it can be stored:

```ts
import { Storage } from "@plasmohq/storage"

const storage = new Storage()

await storage.set("key", "value")
const data = await storage.get("key") // "value"

await storage.set("capt", { color: "red" })
const data2 = await storage.get("capt") // { color: "red" }
```

### Customizing the storage area

It defaults to "sync".

```ts
const storage = new Storage({
  area: "local"
})
```

### Automatically copy data to localStorage

```ts
const storage = new Storage({
  copiedKeyList: ["shield-modulation"]
})
```

The code above will copy the data to Web localStorage when used with content scripts or extension pages.

### Watch (for state sync)

To watch for changes when using the Storage API:

```ts filename="background.ts"
import { Storage } from "@plasmohq/storage"

const storage = new Storage()

await storage.set("serial-number", 47)
await storage.set("make", "plasmo-corp")

storage.watch({
  "serial-number": (c) => {
    console.log(c.newValue)
  },
  make: (c) => {
    console.log(c.newValue)
  }
})

await storage.set("serial-number", 96)
await storage.set("make", "PlasmoHQ")
```

This can be used as a layer to communicate messages across your extension. We demonstrate this in the [with-redux](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-redux) example.

**NOTE:** The Storage API is not available in a Content Script when it is executed in the 'MAIN' world, as it loses its access to the Chrome Extensions APIs.

## Secure Storage

The SecureStorage API extends Storage with data encryption and decryption for at-rest cold storage of sensitive keys. It utilizes the [Web Crypto `SubtleCrypto` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto) which only works in secure contexts (HTTPS).

```ts
import { SecureStorage } from "@plasmohq/storage/secure"

const storage = new SecureStorage()

await storage.setPassword("roosevelt") // The only diff

await storage.set("key", "value")
const data = await storage.get("key") // "value"

await storage.set("capt", { color: "red" })
const data2 = await storage.get("capt") // { color: "red" }
```

## React Hook API

The hook API is designed to streamline the state-syncing workflow between the different pieces of an extension. There are many ways it can be used, but first and foremost you will want to import the hook into your React component:

```tsx
import { useStorage } from "@plasmohq/storage/hook"
```

### Watch and render a value

```tsx
const [hailingFrequency] = useStorage("hailing")
...
{hailingFrequency}
```

### With a custom storage instance

```tsx
import { Storage } from "@plasmohq/storage"
...
const [hailingFrequency] = useStorage({
  key: "hailing",
  instance: new Storage({
    area: "local"
  })
})
```

### Rendering initial value WITHOUT persisting

"Persisting" means writing into the internal memory.

By not persisting the value, only this specific instance of the hook will render the given initial value when there is no value in storage. Other instances can either show `undefined` OR specify their own initial value. To elaborate on this:

Given a `popup.tsx` that sets a static initial value:

```tsx filename="popup.tsx"
const [hailingFrequency, setHailingFrequency] = useStorage("hailing", "42")
...
<input value={hailingFrequency} onChange={(e) =>
  setHailingFrequency(e.target.value)
  }/> // "42"
```

If we subscribe to this key in `content.tsx`, we will see it be `undefined` until `setHailingFrequency` is called with a defined value:

```tsx filename="content.tsx"
const [hailingFrequency] = useStorage("hailing")

return <p>{hailingFrequency}</p> // undefined
```

If we subscribe to this key in `options.tsx`, but with a different static initial value, we will see that value instead:

```tsx filename="options.tsx"
const [hailingFrequency] = useStorage("hailing", "147")

return <p>{hailingFrequency}</p> // "147"
```

With the above setup, suppose we call `setHailingFrequency("8472")` in any of the instances above, we will see that all instances will now show "8472" and will now track the value in storage instead of the initial value.

### Rendering AND persisting initial value

By using a function instead of a static value, the initial value will be persisted in storage memory. The initialize function has one parameter which is the existing value in storage. If there is no value, it is `undefined`.

Let's say we have a `popup.tsx` that initialize the state to "42" if there is nothing in storage:

```tsx filename="popup.tsx"
const [hailingFrequency, setHailingFrequency] = useStorage("hailing", (v) => v === undefined ? "42": v)
...
{hailingFrequency} // "42"
```

Then, if we make a new hook instance in our `content.tsx` or `options.tsx`, we will see the initial value that persisted, without calling `setHailingFrequency`:

```tsx filename="content.tsx"
const [hailingFrequency] = useStorage("hailing")

return <p>{hailingFrequency}</p> // "42"
```

### Advanced usage

When dealing with form input or real-time input, you might need the following:

```tsx
const [hailingFrequency, setHailingFrequency, {
  setRenderValue,
  setStoreValue,
  remove
}] = useStorage("hailing")

return <>
  <input value={hailingFrequency} onChange={(e) => setRenderValue(e.target.value)}/>
  <button onClick={() => setStoreValue()}>
    Save
  </button>
  <button onClick={() => remove()}>
    Remove
  </button>
</>

```

### Usage with Firefox

To use the storage API on Firefox during development you need to add an addon ID to your manifest, otherwise, you will get this error:

> Error: The storage API will not work with a temporary addon ID. Please add an explicit addon ID to your manifest. For more information see https://mzl.la/3lPk1aE.

To add an addon ID to your manifest, add this to your package.json:

```JSON
"manifest": {
  "browser_specific_settings": {
    "gecko": {
      "id": "your-id@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

During development, you may use any ID. If you have published your extension, you can use the ID assigned by Mozilla Addons.
