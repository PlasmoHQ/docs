# Browser Extension Pages

Extension pages are built-in pages recognized by the browser. They include the extension's popup, options, sidepanel and newtab pages.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ‘€">
  Heads up! Make sure to refresh your extension manually when creating a new
  browser extension page as our runtime might not be listening and might not
  update in certain cases.

## Adding a Popup Page

The popup page is a small dialog window that opens when a user clicks on the extension's icon in the browser toolbar. It is the most common type of extension page.

Create a `popup.tsx` file or a `popup/index.tsx` file that exports a default React component. With that, your popup is ready to be used ðŸš€!

See [with-popup](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-popup)

## Adding the Options Page

The options page is meant to be a dedicated place for the extension's settings and configuration.

Create either an `options.tsx` or `options/index.tsx` file to render the options_ui ðŸ‘Œ

See [with-options](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-options-ui)

## Adding a New Tab Page

The New Tab page overrides the default tab and is generally how the browser greets the user.

Create a `newtab.tsx` file or a `newtab/index.tsx` file, and Plasmo will take care of the rest to render your new tab page ðŸ¤˜!

See [with-newtab](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-newtab)

## Adding a Side Panel

The Side Panel allows extensions to display their own UI in the side panel, enabling persistent experiences that complement the user's browsing journey.

Create a `sidepanel.tsx` file or a `sidepanel/index.tsx` file, and Plasmo will take care of the rest to render the UI in the Side Panel. 

See [with-sidepanel](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-sidepanel)

## Adding a Dev Tools Page

The Dev Tools page is a dedicated page that opens when a user opens the Dev Tools for the extension.

Create a `devtools.tsx` file or a `devtools/index.tsx` file, and Plasmo will take care of the rest!

See [with-devtools](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-devtools)
