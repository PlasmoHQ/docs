# Tab Pages

Tab Pages is a feature unique to the Plasmo framework. Unlike [Extension Pages](/framework/ext-pages), Tab Pages are just regular web pages shipped with your extension bundle. Extensions generally redirect to or open these pages programmatically, but you can link to them as well. Use tab pages when you want to have a more elaborate routing setup, a dedicated page for authentication, or a page to show when a user first installs your extension.

## Examples

- [with-tabs](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-tabs)
- [rfc-182](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/plasmo-test/tree/main/rfc/rfc-182-tabs)

## Usage

To add a tab:

1. Create a `tabs` folder in the source directory (project root or `src`)
2. Add a `.tsx` file such as `delta-flyer.tsx`
3. Export a default React component:

```tsx filename="tabs/delta-flyer.tsx"
function DeltaFlyerPage() {
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: "flex",
        flexDirection: "column",
        padding: 16
      }}>
      <h2>Delta Flyer Tab</h2>

      <p>This tab is only available on the Delta Flyer page.</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default DeltaFlyerPage
```

Your tab page will be available under the `/tabs` path in the extension bundle. It will be accessible from the browser under the URL:

```
chrome-extension://<extension-id>/tabs/delta-flyer.html
```
