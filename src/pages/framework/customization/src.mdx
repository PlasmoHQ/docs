# Using the `src` directory for source code

Instead of having your source codes in the root directory, you can put them in a child `src` directory.

## --with-src

Creating a Plasmo project with an `src` directory setup is as simple as:

```bash
pnpm create plasmo --with-src
```

The command above utilizes Plasmo's [example template feature](/framework/workflows/new#with-an-example-template).

<Callout>

Please ensure that the `assets` directory is in the `project` directory NOT the `src` directory.

Please ensure that **ALL source files** including Plasmo's entry files such as `popup.tsx`, `options.tsx`, `background.ts`, `contents/*` etc. are in the `src` directory. Otherwise, Plasmo **WILL NOT** know where to find the entry files, resulting in an empty extension!

This customization only resolves `~` to `/src` for source code
modules. Please see this note about [tilde import
resolution](/framework/import#tilde-).

</Callout>

## Manual Setup

First, copy all your source code files into the `src` directory. Then, for TypeScript to work correctly, you will need to point the resolved `paths` for the `~*` prefix in the `tsconfig.json` file to `"./src/*"`.

The new configuration looks like this:

```json
{
  "extends": "plasmo/templates/tsconfig.base",
  "exclude": ["node_modules"],
  "include": [".plasmo/index.d.ts", "./**/*.ts", "./**/*.tsx"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "~*": ["./src/*"]
    },
    "baseUrl": "."
  }
}
```

See [with-src](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-src) for a full example.
