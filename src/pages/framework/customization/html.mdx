# Replacing the HTML Templates

To replace the default HTML templates, you can create a `.html` file with the same naming convention as the component file. For example, if you have a `popup.tsx` and would like to override the HTML, create a `popup.html` file:

```html filename="popup.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>__plasmo_static_index_title__</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

If you have a `popup/index.tsx` file, create a `popup/index.html` file with content similar to the above.

  You do not need to include the root element or the script tag. The Plasmo
  Framework will handle that for you.
