description: How to use Plasmo content scripts to inject custom behavior into web pages

# Content Scripts

Content scripts run in the context of web pages in an _isolated world_. This allows multiple content scripts from various extensions to coexist without conflicting with each other's execution and to stay isolated from the page's JavaScript.

### Use cases:

- Scraping data from the current web page
- Selecting, finding, and styling elements from the current web page
- [Injecting UI elements into the current web page](/framework/content-scripts-ui)
- [Injecting code into the "main world" context](#injecting-into-the-main-world)

## Adding a single content script

<Callout emoji="ðŸš¨">
  Since Plasmo's default Typescript configuration treats all source files as
  modules, if you don't have any imports or exports in your code, you'll have to
  add an `export {}` line at the start of your file. (You will see this warning
  when creating your first content script!)
</Callout>

Create a `content.ts` file that exports an empty object and hack away!

```ts filename="content.ts"
export {}
console.log(
  "You may find that having is not so pleasing a thing as wanting. This is not logical, but it is often true."
)
```

Reload your extension, open a web page, then open its inspector:

See [with-content-script](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-content-script) for a full example.

## Adding multiple content scripts

Create a `contents` directory for multiple content scripts, and add your content scripts there. Make sure their names describe what they do!

See [with-many-content-scripts](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-many-content-scripts) for an example.

## Config

Sometimes, you'll want to run a content script on certain pages. You can provide a custom content script configuration by exporting a config object from your content script:

```ts
import type { PlasmoContentScript } from "plasmo"

export const config: PlasmoContentScript = {
  matches: ["<all_urls>"],
  all_frames: true
}
```

Working with this configuration object is a breeze thanks to the exported `PlasmoContentScript` type ðŸ¥³.

To learn more about the config and each property, [check out Chrome's official documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/content_scripts/#static-declarative).

## Injecting into the main world

You must inject code into the main world if you'd like to modify the `window` object from your content script. It's not currently possible to declaratively inject content scripts.

Instead, Chrome offers a `chrome.scripting.executeScript` API that lets you inject content scripts into the main world. First, add the scripting permission in your [package.json's 'manifest.permissions' array](/framework/customization/manifest):

```json filename="package.json"
{
  ...
  "manifest" : {
    "permissions": ["scripting"]
  }
}
```

Then, inject your content script into the main world by calling `chrome.scripting.executeScript` from your background service worker:

```ts
chrome.scripting.executeScript(
  {
    target: {
      tabId // the tab you want to inject into
    },
    world: "MAIN", // MAIN to access the window object
    func: windowChanger // function to inject
  },
  () => {
    console.log("Background script got callback after injection")
  }
)
```

For the `func` key, you can pass in a Typescript function from your project, which will automatically convert to a JavaScript function when your extension bundles.

  If you have imports in your injected code, they won't automatically be bundled
  in with it.
</Callout>

See [with-main-world-content-script-injection](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/tree/main/with-main-world-content-script-injection) for an example.

## Fetching external API and CORS

Because content scripts run within the context of a web page, they are subject to the same-origin policy. To mitigate CORS restrictions, you can use the [Plasmo Messaging API](/framework/messaging#message-flow) to proxy the request via your background service worker.

## Importing resources

To import external assets into your content script, you can use the [`url:` scheme](/framework/import#url):

```ts
import myFile from "url:./path/to/my/file/something.js"
```

The `url:` scheme will automatically resolve the `something.js` asset and add it to the `web_accessible_resources` declaration in the built bundle. The above `myFile` variable will be a string containing the URL to the asset:

```sh
> console.log(myFile)

chrome-extension://<your chrome ext id>/something.eb20bc99.js?1656000646313
```

Alternatively, you can use the [`data-base64`](/framework/import#data-base64) or the [`data-text`](/framework/import#data-text) scheme to import and embed the asset directly into your code. For small assets, these schemes should work well.
