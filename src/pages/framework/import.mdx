# Import Resolution

Plasmo framework ships with its own code/asset bundler tailored specifically for extension development. It supports raw/transformed bundle inlining, asset mirroring, environment injection, and more.

## Paths

Plasmo has built-in support for most common import paths such as relative import, `node_module` package import, and `ESM exports` import. It also provides project-relative paths via tilde and absolute imports. To customize your import path further, check out the [Alias Imports Section](/framework/customization/alias).

### Tilde (`~/`)

The tilde import path is a convenient shortcut for the "source code module directory." Plasmo only considers files ending in the following extension to be "source code module":

```ts
export const relevantExtensionList = [
  ".ts",
  ".tsx",
  ".svelte",
  ".vue",
  ".json"
] as const
```

When used outside a source code module or with an asset [scheme](#schemes) such as `data-base64`, `data-text`, or `url`, the tilde (`~`) **always** resolves to the project's root directory where the `package.json` resides. Thus:

- `~rulesets/test.json` used in the [manifest override inside `package.json`](/framework/customization/manifest) resolves to `/rulesets/test.json`
- `data-base64:~assets/image.png` resolves to `/assets/image.png`
- `url:~src/code.js` resolves to `/src/code.js.`

Suppose the tilde is by itself without a scheme and is being used to import a source code module from another source code module. In that case, it has two behaviors depending on whether you are using the default setup or the [the `src` directory setup](/framework/customization/src):

- With the default setup, `~` points to the project root.
- With the `src` directory setup, `~` points to the `src` directory. Thus `~core/code-module.tsx`, resolves to `/src/core/code-module.tsx`.

### Absolute (`/`)

Unlike tilde, the absolute import path will always resolve to the project root (where the `package.json` resides) regardless of the `src` directory. Use the absolute import path if you prefer complete consistency.

### Relative (`./`, `../`)

Use the `./` prefix to import files using paths relative to the current file. For example, to import a file from the same directory as the existing file, use `./file-name`. To import a file from a subdirectory, use `./subdirectory/file-name`. To import a file from a parent directory, use `../file-name`.

## Schemes

Plasmo introduces several "import schemes" that developers can use to import asset files into the extension bundle. The scheme is prefixed to the file path and separated by a colon. For example, `data-base64:~/assets/image.png` is a valid import path.

### raw

The `raw` scheme instructs Plasmo to:

1. Copy the file into the extension bundle at the root level
2. Assign a content hash to distinguish it from other files with similar names

The imported variable is an absolute URL to the file at runtime:

```ts
import imageUrl from "raw:~/assets/image.png"

console.log(imageUrl) // chrome-extension://<extension-id>/image.<hashA>.png
```

### raw-env

The `raw-env` scheme is like the `raw` scheme but with added [environment variables](./env). For example, if you have a file `~/assets/config.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "url": "$PLASMO_PUBLIC_URL"
}
```

And you declared an environment variable `PLASMO_PUBLIC_URL` with the value `https://www.plasmo.com`, then the resulting file will be:

```json
{
  "url": "https://www.plasmo.com"
}
```

> NOTE: `raw-env` is primarily helpful for text-based assets.

### url

The `url` scheme instructs Plasmo to:

1. Transform/bundle/optimize the file for browser consumption (html/js/css/images)
2. Copy the result + dependencies into the extension bundle at the root level
3. Assign a content hash to distinguish it from other files with similar names
4. (Content Script only) Add the file to the `web_accessible_resources` entry

The imported variable is an absolute URL to the file at runtime:

```ts
import styleAUrl from "url:~/a/style.scss"
import styleBUrl from "url:~/b/style.scss"
import codeUrl from "url:~/c/index.ts"

console.log(styleAUrl) // chrome-extension://<extension-id>/style.<hashA>.css
console.log(styleBUrl) // chrome-extension://<extension-id>/style.<hashB>.css
console.log(codeUrl) // chrome-extension://<extension-id>/file.<hashB>.js
```

> Using `url` with image assets will optimize them for size and browser loading.

### data-text

The `data-text` scheme instructs Plasmo to:

1. Read the file's content
2. Transform/bundle/optimize the file for browser consumption (html/js/css/images)
3. Inline the content as a single bundle in a string

```ts
import styleText from "data-text:~/assets/style.scss"

console.log(styleText)
// {
//   "color": "red",
// }
```

### data-text-env

The `data-text` scheme instructs Plasmo to:

1. Read the file's content
2. Inject public environment variables
3. Transform/bundle/optimize the file for browser consumption (html/js/css/images)
4. Inline the content as `string`

`.env`

```ini
PLASMO_PUBLIC_URL=https://itero.plasmo.com
```

`code.json`

```json
{
  "url": "$PLASMO_PUBLIC_URL"
}
```

`content.tsx`

```ts
import codeText from "data-text-env:~/assets/code.json"

console.log(codeText) // To use it as JSON, use JSON.parse(codeText)
// "{
//   "url": "https://itero.plasmo.com",
// }"
```

### data-base64

The `data-base64` scheme instructs Plasmo to:

1. Read the file's content
2. Transform/bundle/optimize the file for browser consumption (html/js/css/images)
3. Convert the result to base64 string and inline it into the code

```ts
import iconBase64 from "data-base64:~/assets/icon.png"

console.log(iconBase64) // data:image/png;base64,etc...
```

### data-env

The `data-env` scheme instructs Plasmo to:

1. Read the file's content
2. Inject public environment variables
3. Transform/bundle/optimize the file for browser consumption (html/js/css/images)
4. Return appropriate runtime asset result

```ts
import data from "data-env:~/assets/data.json"

// Data will be a JSON object, no need to JSON.parse!
console.log(data) // { url: "https://itero.plasmo.com" }
```
