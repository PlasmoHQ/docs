# Getting Started with Itero

The all-in-one browser extension platform that helps you iterate faster.

## TestBed

Testing browser extensions is hard. You either have to wait for draconian review times, or you have to ask your testers to manually install the extension every time you make a change. With Itero TestBed, you can instantly push your browser extension to your beta testers without having to wait for review or manually install the extension.

### Prerequisites

You must have an account on [Itero](https://itero.plasmo.com). If you don't have an account, you can sign up [here](https://itero.plasmo.com).

### Steps

#### 1. Zip your extension files

> Note: You can skip this step if you already have a zip file of your extension.

If you're using the Plasmo Framework, check out the [documentation](./workflows/build#generating-a-zip-bundle) on packaging a zip bundle.

If you're manually zipping, make sure your manifest.json file is at the root of the zip file.

#### 2. Upload your browser extension's zip file on Itero

Take the zip file that you created in the previous step and upload it to Itero. You can do this by going to the [TestBed](https://itero.plasmo.com) page and clicking the "Upload new Extension" button.

#### 3. Share your extension's link with your beta testers

Your beta testers will have to install Plasmo's software, and then install your extension with a single click.
