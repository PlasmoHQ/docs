# Welcome to Itero: The Browser Extension Cloud

Meet Itero, the cloud platform for browser extension development that allows you to iterate faster without a review process, and test new changes with each and every push. Whether you're an individual developer or a team, Itero's easy-to-use platform helps you save time and streamline your workflow.

At [Plasmo](https://www.plasmo.com), we understand the challenges of testing browser extensions, so we've developed [TestBed](./itero/test-bed), our staging environment for browser extension development. With [TestBed](./itero/test-bed), you can quickly and easily test your extensions, and instantly push them to beta testers without waiting for a review or manually installing the extension.

Our streamlined integration with the GitHub workflow ensures that each push to your repository is automatically deployed to your beta testers with the [Itero Builder pipeline](./itero/builder). This saves you time and effort, allowing you to focus on developing your browser extension and receiving feedback from beta testers.

With [Itero Publisher](./itero/publisher), you can publish your browser extension to the Chrome Web Store and Firefox Add-ons Store effortlessly. We also offer the option to publish to the Microsoft Edge Add-ons Store, but you'll need a Microsoft Partner Center account.

If you're looking to convert your extension from MV2 to MV3, Itero has got you covered with our [MV2 to MV3 Converter toolkit](./itero/mv2-to-mv3). This makes the conversion process easy and straightforward, ensuring that your extension is compatible with the latest version of the browser.
