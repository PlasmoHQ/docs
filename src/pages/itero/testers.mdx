# Being a Beta Tester

## How to install a browser extension

> Note: You will need to do this every time you want to install a new extension. Updates to existing extensions are automatically installed and no action is required.

Ask your developer for a link to the beta version of the extension. This link will look something like this: `https://itero.plasmo.com/ext/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

Before you can install the extension, you'll need to download Plasmo's Testbed. You can download it by running the command found on the install page of the extension.

In the screenshot above, because the user was on a Mac, they would copy the `curl -s ` command and paste it into their terminal.

When you run the command, you'll see something like this:

Wait for the installer to download and run.

Once the installer has finished, you'll see the Profiles page. This is where you can install Plasmo Testbed!

> Note: Sometimes, the Profiles page doesn't open automatically. To open it manually, press âŒ˜ + Space, and type "System Preferences" and press enter. If you're still having issues, you can open the Profiles page by going to System Preferences > Profiles.

Click "OK" and click "Install" on the Profiles page to install Plasmo Testbed.
